# Object-Predictor
 A Python application that uses camera input to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to respond to specific actions using neural networks to train a dataset
 
 #  Object Predictor
###  A step towards Digital Vision !

## Inspiration:
**-As Recent advances in deep learning made tasks such as Image and speech recognition possible.
The idea of Scanning and image recognition is very fascinating.        
  -I wanted to dive deeper into the idea like google lens.**

## Objective:
- I have built a deep neural network that can recognize images with an high accuracy of while explaining the techniques used throughout the process.
- Deep learning excels in recognizing objects in images as itâ€™s implemented using 3 or more layers of artificial neural networks where each layer is responsible for extracting one or more feature of the image.

## What it does:
1. Camera will continuously run in the background.
2. A GUI window is used to capture images of objects to store at a specified location.
3. It will then Create different classes for different objects.
4. It will predict the object shown in the camera.


## Challenges  ran into:
*Since I'm new to Deep learning and Machine learning technology so initially it was very difficult for me to research and study about this technology. As I developed this project solo and there were no one to guide or support me wherever I got stuck so developing neural networks project became more challenging to me. But all we need is Determination and Consistency which can make everything possible. *
  

## Accomplishments that I am proud of:
- I was able to build an artificial convolutional neural network that can recognize images with a high accuracy 
- I did so by pre-processing the images to make the model more generic, split the dataset into a number of batches and finally build and train the model.



## What we learned:
- How a Python application uses camera input to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to respond to specific actions using neural networks to train a dataset.
- Also we learned an AI project that is a fully-functioning camera classifier by combining principles of computer vision with principles of neural networks.



## What's next for Object Predictor:
- I wish to add  Text to speech voice assistant for visually Impaired people. 
- I would like to add Search results in accordance with the image for better exposure to the product.
